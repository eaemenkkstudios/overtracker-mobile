# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing to this project.

It's very easy to contribute. First, follow the on the `Setting up` section of the [README](README.md#setting-up), but instead of just cloning the repository, [fork it](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo). 

After you have made changes to the project and tested them, create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) explaining what are the changes you made, what new features were added and/or what bugs were fixed and one of the maintainers of the project will review your code and *probably* merge it.
